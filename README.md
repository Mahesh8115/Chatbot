Rule-Based Chatbot (Python)

A simple rule-based chatbot built using Python. The chatbot interacts with users via the terminal, responding to greetings, questions, and commands using basic if-elif-else logic.


Objective

Create a Python script that simulates a chatbot using conditional statements. This project introduces the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and conversational flow.


Tools & Technologies

Python
- `input()` and `print()` for user interaction
- `if-elif-else` for rule-based responses
- `while` loop for continuous conversation
- `datetime` (optional) for time-related responses


Features

- Responds to greetings: "hi", "hello", "hey"  
- Answers personal questions: e.g., "what is your name?"
